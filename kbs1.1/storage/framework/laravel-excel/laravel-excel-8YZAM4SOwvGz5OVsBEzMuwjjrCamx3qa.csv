"16114702231855","West Indies eye ODI Super League points despite losing series","or teams like Bangladesh and West Indies, dead rubbers are no longer meaningless. The&nbsp;ODI Super League&nbsp;has made it certain that every game is now worth points, aimed towards direct World Cup qualification, or teams have to take the tortuous qualifiers route. Bangladesh cannot take the foot off the gas against a West Indies side that has hardly put forth a meaningful contest in the ODI series so far, particularly with bigger challenges lying ahead this year.The home side has a number of options in their bench that they could test ahead of the more challenging white-ball assignments in New Zealand in March. Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam and allrounder Mohammad Saifuddin could get a run, since they are likely to be part of that squad as well, and are unlikely to play the Tests against West Indies next month.","Bangladesh Vs West Indies 2021","Md Ziaur Rahman","public","cricket,wi,ban,westindiesvsbangladesh","24 Jan, 2021"

"16114731094660","Cricket Introduction","Cricket&nbsp;is a multi-faceted sport with different formats, depending on the standard of play, the desired level of formality, and the time available. One of the main differences is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two&nbsp;innings&nbsp;apiece, and those limited by number of&nbsp;overs&nbsp;in which they have a single innings each. The former, known as&nbsp;first-class cricket&nbsp;if played at the senior level, has a scheduled duration of three to five days (there have been examples of ""timeless"" matches too); the latter, known as&nbsp;limited overs cricket&nbsp;because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 overs, has a planned duration of one day only. A separate form of limited overs is&nbsp;Twenty20, originally designed so that the whole game could be played in a single evening (3 hours), in which each team has an innings limited to twenty overs.Double innings matches usually have at least six hours of&nbsp;playing time&nbsp;each day, with formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea, and additional brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings. Limited overs matches often last at least six hours, with similar intervals and breaks, whilst the more streamlined Twenty20 matches are generally completed in under four hours.&nbsp;T10 cricket&nbsp;is a newer version of the game, based on the principles of other limited overs formats, but with only 10 overs per innings, and the total playing time limited to 90 minutes.Local&nbsp;club cricket&nbsp;teams, which consist of amateur players, rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided intodeclaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or&nbsp;declareslimited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the 20-over format in the evenings.Indoor cricket&nbsp;is a variant of the sport played in sports halls during the winter months.","Cricket","Md Ziaur Rahman","public","cricket","24 Jan, 2021"

In fact, we are going to take part in the parade in India at a time when our country is celebrating 2020-21 year as the birth centenary of our Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and also the 50th year of Bangladesh's independence.""There will be two contingents, one marching contingent and one military band, he said.","Politics","Md Ziaur Rahman","public","army,politics,parade","24 Jan, 2021"
"16115475357008","Determined, dominant Joe Root defies conditions to make batting look easy","As&nbsp;Joe Root, for the second Test in succession, passed 150, you might have thought that he was batting without pressure, in conditions where bowlers were unable to gain any movement or purchase. So comfortable did he seem, so serene was his progress, that it would have been easy to underestimate the size of his achievements.It's only in contrast with his team-mates that it becomes apparent how good a batsman Root is. Having scored 54 percent of England's first-innings runs in the first Test, he has so far scored 55 percent of them in the second. He has scored 305 - yes, 305 - more runs than any other England player in the series.England have had other batsmen of recent vintage who have scored heavily in Asia, of course. With Alastair Cook, you could feel the struggle: the dogged determination to survive and limited number of scoring shots made every innings something of a battle. With Kevin Pietersen, the talent was so extravagantly obvious - remember those slog-sweeps in Mumbai and Colombo? - that you knew you were in the presence of genius.It's not like that with Root. For much of the time, his batting is so unobtrusive it can lure you into thinking what he is doing is straightforward.Think of the way he plays back to the spinners, for example. You won't see many of those singles or dot balls on highlights packages. But they allow him to rotate the strike, release pressure and mess with the bowlers' lengths.More eye-catching are his sweeps. So broad is Root's repertoire of sweep that he can hit the ball in front or behind square on both sides of the wicket. As a result, he is desperately tough to contain. Even on the second evening of this game, coming to the crease with England 5 for 2, he scored so freely that he reached stumps unbeaten on 67 off 77 balls. Individually those strokes may look routine; collectively, they amount to a masterclass.But maybe it was fitting, during the innings in which&nbsp;he passed Pietersen's Test run tally, that he also produced several switch-hits to remind us that, underneath the determination to play the percentages, there lurks an extravagantly talented player. To pick the length, to switch his hands, to time the ball to perfection: Root effectively hit more boundaries left-handed than Dom Sibley, Zak Crawley and Dan Lawrence managed between them.","Srilanka vs England Test Series 2021","Md Ziaur Rahman","public","srilanka,england,srivseng","25 Jan, 2021"
"16115479448977","Joe Root stars with 186 as Lasith Embuldeniya takes seven in tightly-fought contest","Stumps&nbsp;England&nbsp;339 for 9 (Root 186, Buttler 55, Embuldeniya 7-132) trail&nbsp;Sri Lanka&nbsp;381 (Mathews 110, Dickwella 92, Perera 67, Chandimal 52, Anderson 6-40) by 42 runsAnother stunning knock by&nbsp;Joe Root&nbsp;frustrated Sri Lanka on the third day of the second Test at Galle, but his fall right on stumps swung the contest back in the home side's favour.Root's near-flawless 186 sent England to the close still 42 runs adrift after&nbsp;Lasith Embuldeniya&nbsp;claimed seven wickets with his left-arm spin that bamboozled almost everyone, except Root.It was testament to Root's exertions that he fell in gut-wrenching fashion in the last moments of the day, unable to drag his exhausted, cramping body back into his crease in time after nudging Dilruwan Perera to short leg, where Oshada Fernando fired the ball back onto the stumps with an excellent throw.As James Anderson had said on the second evening, you're never too old to improve or too experienced to learn. And as he, Root and&nbsp;Jos Buttler&nbsp;lived that adage as the stand-out performers in a battling England effort in this match so far, the young and inexperienced members of the squad could learn a thing or two from them.On the third day it was Root and, to a lesser extent, Buttler who set the example for the likes of Dom Sibley, Zak Crawley and Dan Lawrence upon whom, as current selection goes, England are looking to build for the future.Root's innings was a masterclass in playing spin. He made batting look easy when, in fairness to the other batsmen, it clearly wasn't as Embuldeniya spun his way to career-best figures and his third five-wicket haul in just his ninth Test.","Srilanka vs England Test Series 2021","Md Ziaur Rahman","public","srilanka,england","25 Jan, 2021"

But it's in every nation's own medium and long-term economic interest to support vaccine equity.""Tedros cited a study commissioned by the Research Foundation of the International Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 45 million companies in over 100 countries.""Vaccine nationalism could cost the global economy up to $9.2 trillion, and almost half of that â€” $4.5 trillion â€” would be incurred in the wealthiest economies,"" he said.The report said that the financial damage of the pandemic in wealthy countries could not be fixed unless the impact of the crisis in developing nations was also addressed, due to the inter-connectivity of economies around the globe.Tedros said investing in the so-called ACT Accelerator programme, to try to curtail the pandemic on a pooled and equitable basis, was therefore not charity, but simply ""economic common sense"".100MN REPORTED CASES LANDMARKTedros said that exactly a year ago, fewer than 1,500 cases of Covid-19 had been reported to the WHO, including just 23 outside of China, where the first clusters of infections were discovered.More than 2.1 million deaths have been recorded since then.""This week, we expect to reach 100 million reported cases,"" said Tedros.""Numbers can make us numb to what they represent: every death is someone's parent, someone's partner, someone's child, someone's friend.""Vaccines are giving us hope, which is why every life we lose now is even more tragic. We must take heart, take hope and take action.""He urged people to stick to the basics of physical distancing, hand washing, avoiding crowds and wearing masks while waiting their turn to get immunised.Michael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, said only one disease, smallpox, had ever been eradicated, so the availability of vaccines against Covid-19 did not mean the disease could be wiped of the face of the Earth.""The bar for success is reducing the capacity of this virus to kill, put people in hospital and destroy our economic and social lives,"" he said.Meanwhile Bruce Aylward, the WHO's ACT Accelerator hub chief, said the goal of vaccination was merely to take the heat out of the pandemic by the end of 2021.""But it is going to take making some tough choices about how we equitably use and allocate what is, right now, a scarce product â€” and will be for some months to come.""","COVID-19","Md Ziaur Rahman","public","covid","26 Jan, 2021"
